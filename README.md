Unity3D tutorial #1 - Stealth
==============================

The [Unity3D tutorial project #01 codename Stealth](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/stealth), the tutorial has 4 chapters. 
I try to go trough the whole process using GitHub, so the development process would be documented with issues and milestones maybe even wiki pages too.

The project so far has the assets imported from the Unity3D Asset Store (so it might seem a bit heavy)
